# Sample TOTP generation

This repository holds TypeScript code to illustrate how to easily generate
time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) based on a shared secret.

The code has a hard-coded secret that matches the secrets used for the following
two QR codes that can be used with any standard TOTP authenticator app to
register the sample accounts, one providing a 6-digit TOTP, the other providing
an 8-digit TOTP, every 30 seconds.
